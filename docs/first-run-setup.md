# First-run setup

The first time you open Kalinka it runs a short setup wizard. It has seven
steps and takes a few minutes. This guide explains what each step asks for
and why.

The wizard is the same in the **app** (Android, Linux, Windows) and in the
**web player** in your browser, with one difference: the web player already
knows which server it belongs to, so it skips step 1 and starts at
**Music sources** (step 2 of 7).

Before you start, the Kalinka server should already be installed and
running on your network — see the [initial setup guide](initial-setup.md).

At the end the wizard saves everything and restarts the server, which takes
about half a minute. Nothing is applied before that, so you can go back and
change your answers at any point.

## Step 1 — Find your server (app only)

The app looks for Kalinka servers on your network and lists what it finds,
with each server's address, response time and version. Tap the one you
want, then tap **Connect**.

- **Rescan** — searches again. Use it if your server is missing; servers
  that just started up sometimes need a second look.
- **Enter Address Manually** — type `<server-ip>:8000` yourself. Use this
  when your network blocks discovery (mDNS), for example on guest or
  isolated Wi-Fi.

## Step 2 — Music sources

Choose what fills your library. You need at least one source.

- **Local files** — the music stored on the server itself. This is always
  on and cannot be turned off.
- **Jamendo** — a free streaming catalogue of independent artists. Turn it
  on if you want it.

Other sources appear here too if their plugins are installed on the server.
You can always add or remove sources later in Settings.

## Step 3 — Set up your sources

Each source you enabled asks only for what it needs.

### Local files

- **Music folders** — the folders on the server that Kalinka scans for
  music. This is the important one: if it points at the wrong place, your
  library stays empty.

  The server installer creates `/srv/kalinka/music` and that folder is used
  by default. Copy your music there and you do not need to change anything.
  If your collection lives somewhere else — a USB drive, a NAS mount, a
  folder in your home directory — add that path here instead.

  One rule: the server runs as the user `kalusr`, so it must be allowed to
  read the folder. If the library stays empty afterwards, permissions are
  the usual reason — see
  [initial setup, step 2](initial-setup.md#2-put-your-music-where-the-server-can-see-it).

- **Enable AI search** — turn this **on** to search your own music by mood,
  genre and how it sounds, instead of only by name. This is what makes
  "something calm for the evening" work on your own library.

  It costs about 500 MB of memory while the server runs, and about 750 MB
  while it is indexing. The first indexing pass takes hours on a large
  library and a slow machine, such as a Raspberry Pi. It runs in the
  background — you can use Kalinka normally while it works, and results get
  better as more tracks are indexed.

### Jamendo

- **Client ID** — required, Jamendo does not work without it. Create a free
  account and an application at the
  [Jamendo Dev Portal](https://devportal.jamendo.com), then paste the
  application's Client ID here.
- **Mood / AI search** — turn this **on** to search Jamendo by mood or
  description as well. The data it needs is downloaded automatically the
  first time.
- **Audio quality** — the streaming format. FLAC is only available for
  tracks whose artist allowed lossless download, and falls back to MP3 for
  the rest.

> **To get smart search everywhere, turn AI search on for both Local files
> and Jamendo.** The two settings are separate: switching it off for one
> source does not affect the other. If you leave both off, search still
> works, but only by matching names.

## Step 4 — Audio output

Pick where the music comes out. Each entry is a Kalinka renderer — the part
that actually plays sound — named after the machine it runs on, for example
*Kalinka Renderer on raspberrypi*.

The **gear** next to an output opens that output's own settings: which
sound device it uses, the audio format, how it handles volume. These apply
immediately and do not need a restart.

If the list is empty, nothing can play yet. Install the Kalinka renderer on
the machine connected to your speakers or DAC, or open the web player in a
browser to use that browser as an output, then press **Check again**.

You can switch outputs at any time later from the cast icon in the player.

## Step 5 — Amplifier or receiver

This decides what handles volume and power.

- **Default volume control** — the output sets its own volume. Choose this
  if the music goes straight to a DAC, sound card or powered speakers.
- **A device from the list** (for example **MusicCast**) — choose this when
  the music plays into an amplifier or receiver that Kalinka can control.
  Volume and power then go to that device, and it may ask for a couple of
  details, such as which zone and which input the server is wired into.

Only devices whose plugins are installed on the server appear here. If
yours is missing, install its plugin on the server later — it shows up in
Settings afterwards.

## Step 6 — Test sound

**Do not skip this one.** It is the quickest way to find out whether your
audio settings actually work, before you finish setup.

Press **Play test sound**. A small window opens with **LEFT** and **RIGHT**
buttons. Press each one: you should hear a short tone from that speaker
only.

What it tells you:

- You hear both tones, on the correct sides — the output works and the
  channels are the right way round.
- You hear nothing — the wrong sound device is probably selected. HDMI,
  analog and USB DAC are separate devices.
- Left and right are swapped — your cables or your speaker wiring are
  crossed.

If something is wrong, the test offers that output's settings — device,
format, volume mode — right there. Change them and test again immediately;
no restart needed.

If you would rather not test now, the button at the bottom says **Skip for
now**, and you can run the same test later from the output picker.

## Step 7 — Almost there

The last step lists everything you chose: server, music sources, audio
output, volume and power, and whether the sound test played. Each row has a
**Change** link that takes you back to that step.

When it looks right, press **Start listening**. Kalinka saves the settings
and restarts the server so they take effect, which takes about half a
minute.

Two things carry on in the background afterwards: scanning your music
folders, and — if you enabled AI search — building the data smart search
needs. Your library and your search results keep improving for a while
after setup finishes. This is normal.

## Changing things later

Nothing here is permanent.

- **Server settings** — tap the server chip at the top of the screen, then
  **Server settings**. Music sources, music folders and AI search all live
  there.
- **Audio output** — the cast icon in the player switches outputs, and the
  gear next to each one opens its settings and its sound test.

## If something goes wrong

- **No servers found** — the app and the server must be on the same
  network, and some routers block discovery between devices. Use **Enter
  Address Manually** with `<server-ip>:8000`.
- **No outputs listed** — the renderer is not running on the machine
  connected to your audio gear, or it cannot reach the server.
- **No sound in the test** — the wrong device is selected. Open the
  output's settings from the gear and try another one.
- **Library is empty** — the music folder path is wrong, or the files are
  not readable by the `kalusr` user.
- **Smart search finds nothing yet** — indexing has not caught up. Give it
  time; on a large library the first pass takes hours.
